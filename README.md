# Matrix calculator

When you start a calculator, you can see that there are entries where you can input number of rows and columns of matrix.
If rows = N and columns = M, matrix will be of size N x M.

Note: These entries cannot be empty. The entries should be either integers or decimal numbers (it should contain point instead of comma) and do not contain any other symbols.

Now, if entries are specified, you can click on "Create Matrix" button to create matrix. It will create a matrix of a specified size. You should input numbers and then click on "RREF Matrix" button.

Note: A created matrix will contain entries with real numbers.

You can change entries of created matrix after you clicked on "RREF Matrix" button. But if you change a size of a matrix, it will delete the previous and create a new one. However, a RREF matrix will not be deleted but it will be changed after you click on the button.
